        <p>
          Hello, My name is Brian Michael and i enjoy creating web applications.
          This is mainly because i enjoy writing code, i started my coding
          journey in 2022 when i realized writing code can create nice looking
          stuff that can be shared and seen by people. It was also mind blowing
          to me that most of the applications i was using were created using
          code, and with that i learned a lot about html , css & javascript
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast-forward to today, i have been working on various projects mostly
          personally
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the projects i have worked on: Online shop with both frontend
          and backend, Api that i store data collected through web scrapping,
          Blogging website and Messaging application
        </p>
